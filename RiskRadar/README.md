# Rainfall and Flood Risk Analysis Using Historical Weather Data

The public application has exactly **two pages: Rainfall and Flood**.

- **Rainfall:** saved historical rainfall near Mumbai, a period selector and one chart at a time with Daily, Monthly, Yearly and Monsoon views; unusually wet days/months and CSV download.
- **Flood:** the original RiskRadar-style annual rainfall, climate and catchment/land/soil inputs. Typical, Drier and Wetter examples; editable area details; Low/Medium/High result; a visual category gauge and CSV download.

The Flood page uses the original saved RiskRadar predictor locally, with the original 13-feature equations, categorical encoder order and risk bands. There are no Kurundwad river-elevation or next-24-hour inputs on this page. The former city classifier is preserved in experiments/kurundwad_flood_risk_v1 but is no longer the public predictor.

The screen is an **annual area-condition susceptibility indicator**, not a time-specific flood alert. It does not show model/evaluation panels or label its internal score as a calibrated flood probability. Technical evidence stays in MODEL_REPORT.md and EVALUATION_RESULTS.md.

The exact deployed XGBoost model is evaluated without fitting or tuning in [the existing-model evaluation](evaluation/existing_model/EVALUATION.md). Reproduced results are 96.89% accuracy, 65.64% positive precision, 79.08% positive recall and 71.74% positive F1 on the inferred original holdout. These are reconstruction metrics rather than independent unseen-data validation. Run `.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/evaluate_existing_model.py` to reproduce scoring. Separate retraining studies do not evaluate the deployed artifact.

## Inputs and behaviour

Three main inputs are annual rainfall, wettest-month rainfall and rainfall variation. Land & weather details contains mean temperature, temperature variation, runoff potential, drainage density/texture, elevation difference, ruggedness, infiltration, climate type, land cover and soil class. All six climate, eleven land-cover and twenty-five soil categories are readable and available.

Rainfall fields accept nonnegative values without the old arbitrary slider maxima. Validation rejects missing/nonfinite/negative measurements, unknown categories, runoff outside 0–100 and inconsistent rainfall totals. A wettest month cannot exceed its year, and annual total cannot exceed twelve wettest months. Original feature-engineering caps are preserved where the fitted predictor requires them; raw annual rainfall is not clipped. Invalid or changed inputs never show a stale assessment. Presets and manual inputs persist across page navigation.

## Run

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run app.py --server.address=127.0.0.1 --server.port=8501
```

Open [RiskRadar](http://127.0.0.1:8501/). The optional start-riskradar.ps1 launcher starts the same app in the background. No separate API service or live data feed is required for either public page. The original api.py is preserved for reference.

## Main files

monitor_page.py is the two-page shell. rainfall_page.py renders historical analysis. riskradar_page.py renders the restored assessment. riskradar_predictor.py validates inputs and calls the original flood_model.pkl, encoders.pkl and feature_columns.pkl. tests/test_riskradar_predictor.py compares the new path against the independent original api.py. scripts/verify_two_page_dashboard.py checks real chart values, all risk categories, edits, invalid inputs and navigation.

Older models, sources, reports and interfaces are preserved in history. The Word report under reports describes an older release and has not been updated for this restoration.
